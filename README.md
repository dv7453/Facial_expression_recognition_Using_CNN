Project Overview
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a computer vision task that involves identifying and classifying human emotions based on facial expressions. By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we can build a model that automatically recognizes emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more from images of human faces.

Dataset Description
Several datasets are commonly used for facial expression recognition, including:

FER-2013 Dataset: Contains 35,887 grayscale images of 48x48 pixels labeled with one of seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
CK+ Dataset: Contains sequences of facial expressions from neutral to peak expression, labeled with emotions.
JAFFE Dataset: Contains images of Japanese female facial expressions with labels.
For this example, we'll assume the use of the FER-2013 dataset.

Model Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is well-suited for this task due to its ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. Here's an outline of a typical CNN architecture for facial expression recognition:

Input Layer: The input is a grayscale image, typically resized to 48x48 pixels.

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply multiple filters to the input image to extract features such as edges, textures, and shapes. The convolutional layers are followed by activation functions (like ReLU) and pooling layers (like MaxPooling) to downsample the feature maps.

Pooling Layers: These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, which helps in reducing computational complexity and overfitting.

Fully Connected Layers: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the output is flattened and fed into fully connected layers to learn non-linear combinations of high-level features.

Output Layer: The final layer uses a softmax activation function to classify the input image into one of the predefined emotion classes.

Implementation Steps
Data Preprocessing

Image Normalization: Scale pixel values to a range suitable for the CNN (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]).
Image Augmentation: Apply transformations like rotation, zoom, shift, and flip to increase the dataset's size and variability, which helps improve model generalization.
Model Architecture

Layer 1: Convolutional Layer (32 filters, 3x3 kernel) + ReLU + MaxPooling (2x2)
Layer 2: Convolutional Layer (64 filters, 3x3 kernel) + ReLU + MaxPooling (2x2)
Layer 3: Convolutional Layer (128 filters, 3x3 kernel) + ReLU + MaxPooling (2x2)
Fully Connected Layers: Dense(128) + ReLU, Dense(7) + Softmax (for 7 classes)
Loss Function

Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss: Used for multi-class classification problems.
Optimizer

Adam: An adaptive learning rate optimizer, which is commonly used due to its efficiency.
Training

Epochs: The model is trained for several epochs, typically ranging from 25 to 50.
Batch Size: A batch size of 32 or 64 is common for training.
Validation: The model is validated on a separate validation set to monitor performance and avoid overfitting.
Evaluation

Accuracy Metrics: Measure overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into the model's performance by showing the correct and incorrect classifications.
